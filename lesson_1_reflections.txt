How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff basically is a linux command that compares two different versions
of the same file.
All you have to do is call "diff -u old new"
The diff method will compare it line to line to highlight the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

This means whenever something goes wrong all I need to do is just go back
to an older version where things were working ok.
Or, I can just jump between versions to track changes happened overtime especially
if there is a collaboration between different members changing the same code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It gives you the flexibility to save what seems logical and in place

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

it makes sense to track the changes happened across files if they are relatable

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
just type them in and spot the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I can always travel back in time and get the working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Maybe version control Haha
